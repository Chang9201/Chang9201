Tecnical Writer | Engineering Program Manager

## About Me

I'm a passionate professional who loves helping others succeed, whether that be through architecting software tooling solutions, creating release notes for new versions of software for autonomous systems, or creating user manuals for large-scale data collection/annotation operations. In my most recent role, I was at Apple SPG as a Testing/Safety Engineering Program Manager where I was responsible for developing tooling solutions to ensure systemic enforcement of safe testing policies. I'm now looking for opportunities in technical writing or project management.
