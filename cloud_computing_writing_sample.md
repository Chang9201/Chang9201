## Definition of Cloud Computing

You own a smartphone and you've heard the term "cloud" thrown around in relation to your data storage, but you've always been afraid to ask what Cloud Computing actually means. What is this "cloud" and why are your photos all being stored there? Let's start by taking a look at a few different definitions.

- [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing): Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing): Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services - including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence - over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-computing): Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), as services over the internet.
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing): Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

While there are small differences, all of the definitions above seem to agree that cloud computing is a service which provides computing resources for its users. For example, if you're currently storing some family photos in Google Cloud, those family photos (unless you've downloaded them to your device) would not be taking up your device's memory. Instead, they would be stored in Google's data center somewhere.

So if that's the case, how can you access your family photos?
